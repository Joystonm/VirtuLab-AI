# VirtuLab AI - Hackathon Pitch

## 🎯 Problem
- **Millions of students** can't perform real science experiments due to lack of labs, expensive equipment, and safety hazards
- **Existing virtual labs** are either paid (Labster ~$200/year) or lack interactive AI guidance  
- **Teachers can't give 1:1** personal attention to each student

## 🚀 Solution — VirtuLab AI
**VirtuLab AI = Free 3D Virtual Lab + AI Science Tutor**

### Physics Lab
- Build circuits, test Newton's laws, simulate optics, motion & forces

### Chemistry Lab  
- Mix chemicals safely in 3D → see reactions visually

### AI Tutor (Groq + Tavily)
- **Detects mistakes instantly** (e.g., wrong wiring, wrong formula)
- **Explains why** something happens in simple terms
- **Suggests new challenges** ("Can you build a circuit where the bulb stays on even if one switch is off?")
- **Tavily ensures** explanations are fact-checked & textbook-accurate, not hallucinated

## ⚙️ How it Works
1. Student selects an experiment (e.g., Circuit, Acid-Base Neutralization)
2. Interacts in a 3D lab environment (drag wires, mix beakers, drop objects)
3. Experiment logs are sent to backend (Appwrite + Node.js)
4. **Groq LLM** → analyzes setup & gives reasoning
5. **Tavily API** → adds verified references  
6. Response returned in **<1 second** → shown in AI Tutor panel

## 🖥️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend/UI** → React + Tailwind CSS
- **3D Environment** → Three.js + React Three Fiber
- **Physics Simulation** → Cannon.js / Ammo.js
- **AI Tutor** → Groq LLM (fast reasoning) + Tavily API (fact-grounded answers)
- **Backend** → Node.js + Appwrite
- **Deployment** → Vercel (frontend), Appwrite Cloud (backend)

## 🏆 Hackathon WOW Factor
- **EdTech + AI + 3D** → Combines 3 high-impact domains
- **Live Demo Value**: Judges can drag & drop a wire in a circuit → bulb lights up → AI Tutor instantly explains why
- **Scalability**: Expandable to Math (3D vectors), Biology (DNA models), or Astronomy (solar system sim)
- **Impact**: Makes science education free, safe, and accessible worldwide

## 🔥 In Short
**VirtuLab AI = Labster ($200/year/student) + Duolingo-style AI Tutor → Free, Browser-based, Accurate Science Lab powered by Appwrite + Groq + Tavily**
